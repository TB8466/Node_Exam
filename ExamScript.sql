"Hello everyone,
Today we are trying to push extra office supplies on our customers.
So make sure that you ask every customer if they would like an ekstra pen or notebook.
We are also celebrating Jim's 10 year anniversary with the company this friday at 1PM.
Furthermore: Please stop treating the workplace as a landfill.
There are 20 trash cans on this floor alone!
Best regards -John Smith CEO",
